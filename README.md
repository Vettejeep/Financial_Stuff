# Financial Market Perspectives
## Ratio charts of key Exchange Traded Funds and other assets. 
## Primarily against the S&P 500 and Gold - dozens of comparisons. 
### Ratio charts give long term perspective on which assets are outperforming the base asset class.

#### Note how Gold outperformed the S&P 500 from about 2001 to 2011, then the S&P 500 had been better until recently. We can observe that Gold has moved significantly higher in 2020 relative to the S&P 500. RSI has been recently added to the charts, as well as 1 year plots.
